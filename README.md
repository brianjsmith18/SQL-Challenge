# SQL-Challenge

In this assignment, I researched employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. As part of the challenge, all that remained of the database of employees from that period were six CSV files. In order to complete the data engineering and analysis, I designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data.
